A mobile application that allows users to share the location of available parking spots. Users will place a marker in locations that have three or more open parking spaces around them, if there is not already a marker placed by a previous user.

Users will simply need to tap their screen to place a marker at the location that has available parking. The marker that is placed will be blue by default, and is indicated on the screen what state it is.

Here is a depiction of multiple markers placed in parking lots that have 3 or more open spaces.

If a user arrives and finds that there are no longer 3 open spaces, they will tap that marker and change it to red. This changes the state of the marker and indicates to user that they should find alternative parking.

Here is a depiction of a marker's state changed to reflect there are no longer a sufficient number of spots for parking.

All of this information is stored in Meteor: where markers are placed, and what state they are in.
